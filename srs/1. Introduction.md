## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functions and requirements of the **Tazamun** software. It focuses on functional and non-functional requirements of the software in release version 1.0

This SRS clearly defines the software's requirements and offers a comprehensive overview of the software's functionality, targeted user groups, and the components required to achieve the software's goals. The intended audience includes primarily open-source contributors and volunteers, those can be software developers, testers, or system administrators.

This SRS serves as a non-binding reference document for the open-source community. It establishes the baseline requirements that should be to fulfilled when developing Tazamun version 1.0

**Disclaimer**: Parts of this SRS are generated with the help of AI. **BUT** every single line was thoroughly examined and modified and/or corrected.

### 1.2 Scope

Tazamun is an open-source cross-browser synchronization system designed to unify and centralize the browsing experience across multiple web browsers and devices. The primary purpose of Tazamun is to eliminate the fragmentation that occurs when users work with different browsers across various devices and platforms. The browsers supported by version 1.0 are **Mozilla Firefox**, **Google Chrome**, and **Microsoft Edge**.

#### System Purpose and Objectives

- Eliminate the need for manual export/import operations when transferring browser data between different browsers
- Enable seamless transitions between different devices and browsers without loss of context or productivity
- Centralize the browsing experience by maintaining consistency of key browser components across multiple platforms
- Provide a vendor-neutral synchronization solution that respects user privacy and data ownership

Tazamun addresses the common problems faced by users who utilize multiple browsers due to device constraints, work requirements, or personal preferences, allowing them to maintain a consistent browsing environment regardless of which browser they are currently using.

#### Key Features

- Bookmarks Synchronization: Maintain a unified bookmark collection across all supported browsers, with automatic organization and conflict resolution.
- Tab Synchronization: Replicate open tabs across browsers, allowing users to continue their browsing session on a different browser without losing context.
- History Synchronization: Maintain a unified browsing history across all browsers, enabling consistent history search and suggestions.
- Extension Synchronization: Track installed extensions across browsers and assist users in finding and installing equivalent extensions when an exact match isn't available.
